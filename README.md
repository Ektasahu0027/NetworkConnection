# NetworkConnection

### This project is used to check network connection at every second- 

   ### 1.When the network connection is avalible its shows the text message that is "Network connection is avalible" 
   ### 2.When network connection is not avalible its shows the Progressbar and text message that is "no Network connection avalible"
   
   ### This is the Screenshot-
