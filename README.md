# NetworkConnection

### This project is used to check network connection at every second- 

   1.When the network connection is avalible its shows the text message that is "Network connection is avalible" 
   2.When network connection is not avalible its shows the Progressbar and text message that is "no Network connection avalible"
   
   ### Here is the Screenshot-
